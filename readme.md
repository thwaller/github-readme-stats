# GitHub Stats Card

Available ranks are S+ (top 1%), S (top 25%), A++ (top 45%), A+ (top 60%), and B+ (everyone).
The values are calculated by using the [cumulative distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function) using commits, contributions, issues, stars, pull requests, followers, and owned repositories.
The implementation can be investigated at [src/calculateRank.js](./src/calculateRank.js)

### Hiding individual stats

To hide any specific stats, you can pass a query parameter `?hide=` with comma-separated values.

> Options: `&hide=stars,commits,prs,issues,contribs`

### Adding private contributions count to total commits count

You can add the count of all your private contributions to the total commits count by using the query parameter `?count_private=true`.

_Note: If you are deploying this project yourself, the private contributions will be counted by default. Otherwise, you need to choose to share your private contribution counts._

> Options: `&count_private=true`

### Showing icons

To enable icons, you can pass `show_icons=true` in the query param.

### Themes
